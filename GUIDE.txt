'freeCodeCamp (also referred to as Free Code Camp) is a non-profit educational
organization[4] that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online
community forum, chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to
make learning software development accessible to anyone.'

'Beginning with tutorials that introduce students to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, students
progress to project assignments that they complete either alone or in pairs. Upon
completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other nonprofits to build web
applications, giving the students practical development experience.[5]'

'The self-paced curriculum[16] involves 1,400 hours of interactive coding challenges and web development projects, plus 800 hours of
contributing to open-source[17] projects for nonprofits and is constantly expanded by more challenges and projects.[5] This translates
into about one year of full-time coding. The curriculum is divided into Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data
Structures, Front End Libraries, Data Visualization, APIs and Microservices, and Information Security and Quality Assurance.
Participants receive a certificate after completing each section.[18]'

'The curriculum emphasizes pair programming, intended to foster a culture of collaboration and shared learning, which can overcome
a student's doubts about the adequacy of their skills (popularly referred to as “impostor syndrome”).[19]'

'The languages and technologies currently taught by freeCodeCamp include HTML5, PHP, CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap,
Sass, React.js, Node.js, Python, Express.js, MongoDB, and Git.[20]'

'To celebrate freeCodeCamp's 8th birthday on October 25, 2022, Quincy Larson published a tweet that announced free accredited
degree programs in mathematics and computer science are currently in active development. Official release dates are still to be
determined.[21]'

'In 2023, freeCodeCamp partnered with Microsoft to develop a Foundational C# Certification.[22]'

'In 2024, freeCodeCamp runs the largest programming channel on YouTube[citation needed], with 8.94 million subscribers.[23] They have
made more than 700 full-length programming courses freely available there, and new courses are published every week.[24]'
